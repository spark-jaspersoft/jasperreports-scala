JasperReports Scala Library
=============================


1. ANT Build Tool
-----------------------------

In order run the sample application provided with this project, 
you need to have the ANT build tool installed on your system. 
You can get a copy of this tool and details about how to use it 
at this address: http://ant.apache.org/


2. Compile the source files
-----------------------------

This project uses Apache Maven to compile the source code.  In the 
project's root directory there is a pom.xml file that exposes 
different targets and helps compile the Java source files, the 
documentation or build the JAR file.  
Make sure you have the MVN build tool correctly installed on your machine
and then launch "mvn clean install" from the command line in the root directory 
to compile the source code and build the modified JasperReports JAR file.


3. Run the sample
-----------------------------

You'll need the build.xml file included in the samples folder of the
JasperReports distribution to build the sample Scala application.  The sample
report uses an empty data source, thus the hsqldb database included with the
JasperReports samples is not required



4. Support and training
-----------------------------
